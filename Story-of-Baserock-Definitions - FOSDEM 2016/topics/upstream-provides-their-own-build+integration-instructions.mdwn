# Upstream projects providing their own build+integration instructions

-> Approaches:

    language-specific, e.g. CPAN, PyPI, RubyGems
        -> only partial dependency information

-> Needs:
    * a universal way of referring to dependencies. Not as hard as you think:
      the URL of the version control repo or .doap file would do it. 'Import'
      tools could use this info.
