Git mirroring

# All sources are mirrored into a Git server
# (we use an appliance system named Trove
# that makes this convenient).

# Reduces complexity of build tool and definititions
# language, and is convenient for development
# too.

# Folk sometimes clone stuff from git.baserock.org
# just because URL is predicatable
