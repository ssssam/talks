# Baserock - hopes and dreams

-> Use the term 'manifesto'? We never used it before, but seems appropriate

-> It's hard to discuss this right at the beginning without spoiling a lot of
the talk, right? or not?

* There were a few key radical ideas (I may be mis-quoting):

  - everything in Git
     -> This works great!

  - build instructions described in a declarative, structured JSON
    format (.morph files)
        [json-vs-yaml]

  - native compile only
        [native-compile-vs-cross-compile]

  - build instructions stored in upstream repos
        [upstream-project-providing-their-own-build+integration-instructions]

  - proscribed workflow for developers:

        [editing-tools]

  - atomic upgrade & rollback using Btrfs

    -> Btrfs still isn't something you can enforce on people
    -> Rollback and upgrade actually works great, but OStree approach
       is probably better due to working with existing filesystems

  - the death of "packaging" ...

    * why I used "build+integration instructions" rather than "packaging" in the title.
    * this is kind of hyperbolic, what it meant was:
        * using upstream directly as much of possible instead of patching (some distros do this already more than others, apparently Arch is good in this respect)
        * avoiding the combinatorial explosion that comes from
          attempting to support arbitrary sets of packages
          at arbitrary versions
        
      [variants]
