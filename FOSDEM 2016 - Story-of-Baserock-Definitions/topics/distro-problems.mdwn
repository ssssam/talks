Desktop distros and their problems!

-> sent to baserock-dev !

Arch Linux:
  - infinite number of possible configurations that cannot all be tested
  - upgrades are not atomic
  - cannot rollback after upgrade

Baserock reference systems:
  - lack of packages
  - lack of easy runtime configurability
  - lack of momentum
  - lack of good documentation
  - no serious handling of security updates
  - rebuild of a single component may require rebuilding 1000s of packages

Debian/Ubuntu:
  - very complex, lots of moving parts, many of which overlap
  - sources spread across many repos of different types
    -> dgit mitigates this problem: it makes all Debian source packages
       available through consistant Git interface
  - infinite number of possible configurations that cannot all be tested
    -> reproducible-builds project will help this to an extent
  - upgrades are not atomic
  - cannot rollback after upgrade
  - packages lag behind upstream versions at times
  - packages sometimes have a big delta compared to upstream

Fedora:
  - very complex, lots of moving parts, many of which overlap
  - infinite number of possible configurations that cannot all be tested
    -> rpm-ostree project will help with this: you can create a manifest
       that is a specific set of tested packages, and provide the entire
       tree as a single OSTree commit. Users can then layer changes on
       top of the well-known base image, which could be reapplied on each
       upgrade of the base OS.
  - upgrades are not atomic
    -> rpm-ostree project will help with this: a rootfs managed with `ostree`
       can be upgraded atomically
  - cannot rollback after upgrade
    -> rpm-ostree project will help with this: a rootfs managed with `ostree`
       can be rolled back to an old version

Gentoo:
  - no way to share prebuilt artifacts
  - infinite number of possible configurations that cannot all be tested
  - upgrades are not atomic
  - cannot rollback after upgrade

GNU Guix Software Distribution:
  - lack of packages
  - nonstandard filesystem layout makes packaging some software very difficult
  - rebuild of a single component may require rebuilding 1000s of packages
    -> experimental 'grafts' feature solves this: https://www.gnu.org/software/guix/manual/html_node/Security-Updates.html
  - no serious handling of security updates

NixOS:
  - lack of packages
  - nonstandard filesystem layout makes packaging some software very difficult
  - rebuild of a single component may require rebuilding 1000s of packages
  - I'm not sure how quickly NixOS handle security updates currently
