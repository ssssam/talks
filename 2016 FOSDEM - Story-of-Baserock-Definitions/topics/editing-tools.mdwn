# Tools for editing 

    -> Not going to talk about this, but it was a bad idea. In my
       experience 'workflow' is often a sign of something that is
       too complicated, and it should be broken down to pieces people
       understand so they can create whatever workflows they want.

-> Not sure whether to count debhelper as 'editing tool': it's part of the
   *format* in my opinion.
