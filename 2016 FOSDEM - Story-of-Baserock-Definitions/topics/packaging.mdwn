# Packaging

I've explicitly used the term 'build+integration instructions' rather
than 'packaging instructions', not because I want to get an award for
longest talk title,  but because it's kind of a loaded term.

It implies:
  - systems are not in a known state -- hard to debug them. If you install
  - carrying a big delta???
  - 

 I think package management isn't a necessity.

Runtime configurability: can be achieved with sandboxing tools e.g. Docker,
xdg-app.

I'm in favour of 'thin' distributions, not because I think policies and coherence are irrelevant, but because it just complicates the world of
software having all these layers. I hope we can agree that it's complicated enough.
