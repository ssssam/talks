In the right hands
  Yocto can do great work, but in the wrong hands it fails because:
    - it's not rigorous about where source is fetched from
    - patches are committed to Git as files and lose context
    - recipes exist in a global namespace where anything can override anything
      else
    - it's not rigorous about doing isolated builds, or rebuilding
      when a dependency changes: you have a 'golden master', you
      can't reproduce an exact build again from the same sources
