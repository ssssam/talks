# Problems with Baserock as it is now

Rebuilds from scratch if you change something low down the stack.
If you have to rebuild qtwebkit, for example, this sucks.
    -> Early idea of auto-detecting what ABI is exposed, but it's hard to
       really know if some file affects the build of something else, without
       actually being told (like Bazel, for example -- full incremental
       builds but you can't reuse existing Makefiles)
    -> this is a problem if you do automated versioning, I guess

Sometimes not clear why builds start from scratch instead of using the cache.
Did I change something by accident? Is the cache down? Am I on the wrong branch?

No support for variants [variants]

Native compile is too slow in many cases. -
